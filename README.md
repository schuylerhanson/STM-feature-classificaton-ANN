# STM-feature-classificaton-ANN
Neural network for feature classification in STM images

The goal is to create a prototype program that classifies molecular features in STM (scanning tunneling microscopy) images. STM and more broadly, SPM (scanning probe microscopy), are tools used to probe molecular properties on nanometer scales. A bias voltage is imposed between a probe tip and a conductive surface containing sample, and current is tunneled that reflects sample local density of electron states (LDOS). Typical ambient temperature STM image datasets often have high noise due to probe drift, sample contamination, variable LDOS corresponding to a same species.
